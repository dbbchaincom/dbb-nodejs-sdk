/**
 * PKCE, pronounced “pixy” is an acronym for Proof Key for Code Exchange.
 * The key difference between the PKCE flow and the standard
 * Authorization Code flow is users aren’t required to provide a client_secret.
 * In place of the client_secret, the client app creates a unique string value,
 * code_verifier, which it hashes and encodes as a code_challenge.
 * When the client app initiates the first part of the Authorization Code flow, it sends a hashed code_challenge.
 * Once the user authenticates and the authorization code is returned to the client app,
 * it requests an access_token in exchange for the authorization code.
 * In this step, the client app must include the original unique string value in the code_verifier parameter.
 * If the codes match, the authentication is complete and an access_token is returned.
